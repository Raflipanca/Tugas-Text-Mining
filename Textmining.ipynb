              "  'A chain restaurant from Japan which serves rice bowl. The main menu: beef and chicken rice bowl with flavor (original, yakiniku, teriyaki, blackpepper) and sauce/topping options (egg mayo, creamy, chilli, etc). For side menus, you can choose veggies, fried dumpling, tempura, or miso soup.Only ocha drink is refillable. Other drinks are sparklings, juice, or sweetened tea. Rice bowl tastes delicious, but in my opinion, the original one is a bit too salty. I hope the salad in the set menu is in bigger portion 😄',\n",

Besides its large parking lot, this 2-floor building provides a quite large hall for gathering, parties, etc. It serves great combination of fried chicken and chili-cheese sauce 🌶️ 🧀 However, eating there is quite uncomfortable since the sofa makes the customer slip easily when sitting. To add, the chicken that I ate was actually re-fried so it was hard to chew the meat 🍗 Somehow, it's not better than the other Richeese outlets. Needs improvement on your management 🙏🏻\",\n",

Besides its large parking lot, this 2-floor building provides a quite large hall for gathering, parties, etc. It serves great combination of fried chicken and chili-cheese sauce 🌶️ 🧀 However, eating there is quite uncomfortable since the sofa makes the customer slip easily when sitting. To add, the chicken that I ate was actually re-fried so it was hard to chew the meat 🍗 Somehow, it's not better than the other Richeese outlets. Needs improvement on your management 🙏🏻\",\n",

The plus point is the place is quite comfy, with large parking lot and good service. The food is good but for me who prefer Italian to American pizza, it’s actually not my best option. But it’s the taste of pizza hut as you already know. I want to also note that when I ordered dessert they seem to give me frozen strawberry which tasted old, not fresh anymore. Sp I hope this is not what they usually serve. This place is also located in a strategic area. However I cannot find an access for disable, you need to go upstairs to reach the restaurant. I don’t see any elevator either. The waiting time is quite long, which I don’t expect from a pizza place which looks like a fast food restaurant to me. As for the drinks, overall, I think they’re just overpriced.'},\n",

The plus point is the place is quite comfy, with large parking lot and good service. The food is good but for me who prefer Italian to American pizza, it’s actually not my best option. But it’s the taste of pizza hut as you already know. I want to also note that when I ordered dessert they seem to give me frozen strawberry which tasted old, not fresh anymore. Sp I hope this is not what they usually serve. This place is also located in a strategic area. However I cannot find an access for disable, you need to go upstairs to reach the restaurant. I don’t see any elevator either. The waiting time is quite long, which I don’t expect from a pizza place which looks like a fast food restaurant to me. As for the drinks, overall, I think they’re just overpriced.\n",

              "  'Everyone knows pizza hut since it was one among the first pizza restaurants in Indonesia. I personally rate this place as a standard pizza hut restaurant. The plus point is the place is quite comfy, with large parking lot and good service. The food is good but for me who prefer Italian to American pizza, it’s actually not my best option. But it’s the taste of pizza hut as you already know. I want to also note that when I ordered dessert they seem to give me frozen strawberry which tasted old, not fresh anymore. Sp I hope this is not what they usually serve. This place is also located in a strategic area. However I cannot find an access for disable, you need to go upstairs to reach the restaurant. I don’t see any elevator either. The waiting time is quite long, which I don’t expect from a pizza place which looks like a fast food restaurant to me. As for the drinks, overall, I think they’re just overpriced.',\n",
